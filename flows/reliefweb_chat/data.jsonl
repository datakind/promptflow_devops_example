As of January 2024, a total of 540,949 individuals, including 279,618 children, were recorded crossing the border at points of entry. Of those that have crossed the border, approximately 20 percent are refugees. The influx of South Sudanese returnees, and Sudanese refugees has led to overcrowding in the two Transit Sites at the point of entry through Wunthow. Since the start of January, the delays in onward transportation and the refusal of Sudan refugees to move to refugee camps has led to a pooling of individuals at the Transit Sites, contributing to overcrowding and severely over-stretched services.', \"In places of return, returnees face numerous challenges, including economic hurdles. According to the Famine Early Warning System Network (FEWS) report in January 2024, some among the returnee population who are in their places of origin are at risk of experiencing Catastrophe Integrated Phase Classification (IPC Phase 5) due to insufficient assets, severely restricted coping abilities and heavy reliance on aid. Areas such as Nyirol, Duk, and Uror in Jonglei State; certain parts of Upper Nile State; and Aweil East in Northern Bahr El Ghazal State are particularly in dire need, as they face significant challenges from a large number of returnees and ongoing insecurity, which hinder households' livelihoods and occasionally disrupt food assistance distribution.\", 'The South Sudanese pound is losing its value against the dollar, which leads to skyrocketing prices, with the majority of the population having low purchasing power in the country. The price analysis from the Cash Working Group’s Joint Market Monitoring Initiative indicates changes in the cost of essential items in South Sudan. In January 2024, the prices of essential food items showed fluctuations. Sorghum grain decreased by 681 SSP per kilogram (9 per cent), while beans increased by 2,000 SSP per kilogram (5 per cent). Salt decreased by 643 SSP per kilogram (5 per cent), and cooking oil remained stable at 2,000 SSP per liter. These price changes have significant implications for the cost of living in South Sudan. The consistent rise in food prices exacerbates the economic challenges individuals and households face, making it harder for them to meet their daily needs.', 'The influence of climate change profoundly affects the population and has led to protracted flood conditions in Jonglei, Unity, and the Upper Nile States. By April 2024, these regions are anticipated to experience alarmingly high and severe levels of malnutrition. According to data from the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), over 1.7 million children under five will likely endure malnourishment during the year. The flood-stricken zones confront the most acute malnutrition due to the proliferation of waterborne illnesses and cramped living conditions exacerbated by restricted access to food and livelihood sources. Notably, Rubkona County in Unity State is forecasted to reach an unprecedented IPC Acute Malnutrition Phase 5 by April 2024. This is the highest attainable level, reflecting the ongoing flood crisis and severe economic shocks causing a surge in staple food prices by more than 120 per cent since April.', 'The prevailing issues of conflict and insecurity in South Sudan are significant factors that contribute to humanitarian needs. The occurrence of sub-national and intercommunal violence, crime, and impunity have led to the displacement of many individuals and have made it difficult to access essential services. The protection crisis in South Sudan is particularly severe for women and children, who are at a higher risk of experiencing violence, exploitation, and abuse.\\nThis includes conflict-related sexual violence, gender-based violence (GBV), and an increasing number of child protection concerns. Communal conflicts and cattle raiding have been reported in the month of January. For instance, clashes in Agok and some parts of Abyei on the 27th of January led to the disruption of humanitarian activities, including the closure of schools and Nutrition Stabilization Centers in Abyei. In Jonglei, communal conflict erupted, leading to the loss of lives of 30 people and others injured. This subsequently disrupted the delivery of humanitarian services in Ayod, Duk, and Uror counties of Jonglei State. Inter states conflict between communities of Marial Wau and Gogrial East of Warrap State led to the loss of lives; the conflict also hindered the movement of humanitarian personnel between Wau and Warrap, thus hampering the delivery of humanitarian services in Warrap, which is being supported from Wau UNICEF Field Office.', 'Disease outbreaks are common. A Yellow Fever outbreak was declared by the National Ministry of Health on the 24th of December 2023 in Western Equatoria State. A Yellow Fever prevention campaign has been ongoing in the Western Equatoria State, focusing on several counties: Yambio, Tambura, Nzara and Ibba.

In addition to conflicts, the outbreak of Marburg Virus in Equatorial Guinea in early 2023 led to multicountry public health emergency coordination and preparedness measures in Gabon and Cameroon to prevent the spread of the disease.', 'Whilst West and Central Africa has witnessed numerous coup d’état in recent years, political instability was particularly high in 2023. The fallout from the July 2023 coup in Niger led to the imposition of sanctions, and obstacles to ways of working that impacted supply chains beyond Niger. This was followed by a coup in Gabon in August 2023 and political instability in several other countries including Guinea Bissau and Sierra Leone later in the year. In Mali, the announcement in July 2023 of the expulsion of MINUSMA created a volatile operating environment and the subsequent military operations have seen displacements into Mauritania and other neighbouring countries. The UNICEF West and Central Africa Regional Office has supported initiatives across the region to analyse and prepare for political risk and ensure operational continuity should obstacles materialize.', 'Country Offices in West and Central Africa continued to focus on strengthening risk analysis and preparedness capacity in 2023. Countries such as Cabo Verde issued alerts and preparedness measures as a result of seismic activity, and risk analysis in Guinea enabled UNICEF to prepare and response to a fuel explosion in Conakry late in the year. Following large political protests in Senegal in 2023 that saw the closure of some schools and protection risks for children, UNICEF focused on contingency planning and preparedness measures to ensure readiness ahead of presidential elections in 2024.', '\\nNigeria\\n+ 40 more\\n', '\\nNigeria\\n+ 40 more\\n', '\\nGuinea\\n+ 40 more\\n', '\\nNigeria\\n+ 47 more\\n', \"\\n\\nReliefWeb's Terms & Conditions.\\n\\n\", '© 2024 all rights reserved.', 'Related Platforms', 'Other OCHA Services', '\\xa0'], 'primary_country': {'href': 'https://api.reliefweb.int/v1/countries/75', 'id': 75, 'name': 'Democratic Republic of the Congo', 'shortname': 'DR Congo', 'iso3': 'cod', 'location': {'lat': -4.03833, 'lon': 21.7587}}, 'country': [{'name': 'Benin'}, {'name': 'Burkina Faso'}, {'name': 'Cameroon'}, {'name': 'Central African Republic'}, {'name': 'Chad'}, {'name': 'Congo'}, {'name': \"Côte d'Ivoire\"}, {'name': 'Democratic Republic of the Congo'}, {'name': 'Equatorial Guinea'}, {'name': 'Gabon'}, {'name': 'Gambia'}, {'name': 'Ghana'}, {'name': 'Guinea'}, {'name': 'Guinea-Bissau'}, {'name': 'Liberia'}, {'name': 'Mali'}, {'name': 'Mauritania'}, {'name': 'Niger'}, {'name': 'Nigeria'}, {'name': 'Senegal'}, {'name': 'Sierra Leone'}, {'name': 'Sudan'}, {'name': 'Togo'}], 'source': [{'href': 'https://api.reliefweb.int/v1/sources/1979', 'id': 1979, 'name': \"UN Children's Fund\", 'shortname': 'UNICEF', 'longname': \"United Nations Children's Fund\", 'spanish_name': 'Fondo de las Naciones Unidas para la Infancia', 'homepage': 'http://www.unicef.org', 'type': {'id': 272, 'name': 'International Organization'}}], 'format': [{'id': 10, 'name': 'Situation Report'}], 'url': 'https://reliefweb.int/node/4041636', 'date': {'original': '2024-02-27T00:00:00+00:00', 'changed': '2024-02-27T12:39:55+00:00', 'created': '2024-02-27T10:38:26+00:00'}, 'endpoint': 'reports'}, {'id': 4034771, 'title': 'Sudan Food Security Alert, February 1, 2024', 'status': 'published', 'body': ['\\nSudan\\n', 'Conflict in Sudan’s Breadbasket Threatens National Food Availability', 'Washington, D.C. – Fighting in Sudan has spread into the country’s breadbasket, and the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) is reporting that new disruptions to trade and harvesting, in addition to challenges in importing, pose a significant threat to national food availability.', 'In an Alert issued Thursday, FEWS NET warned that the already severe food security situation in Sudan is worsening amid a recent expansion of hostilities, large-scale population displacement, atrocities against civilians, the destruction of goods and infrastructure, pervasive looting, and poor humanitarian access.', '“Attacks in mid-December interrupted the main season harvesting and cultivation of winter wheat in highly productive areas of Sudan, and we are expecting major impacts on national food availability,” FEWS NET Senior Food Security Analyst Emily Turano said. “Nearly one-third of the population of Sudan is in need of emergency food assistance, making it one of the world’s worst food crises.”', 'The new fighting has significantly disrupted commercial trade flows and humanitarian assistance, and hunger is expected to worsen in heavily conflict-affected areas.

      in Sudan, South Sudan, and Chad paints a grim picture of interconnected
      humanitarian crises fuelled by escalating conflict, widespread
      displacement, and climate shocks. Each nation faces unique challenges, yet
      they share a common thread of desperate need demanding immediate global
      attention.\",             \"In Sudan, the ongoing battle between the
      Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) shows no
      signs of abating. The RSF offensive has captured several towns in Al
      Jazira, including Wad Madani, the second-largest city, raising concerns
      about further expansion towards southern and eastern
      regions.\",             \"Confrontations between SAF and RSF also occurred
      in various regions, including West Kordofan, Nyala, South Darfur, and El
      Fasher. The uncertainty of RSF activities in Sennar, Kassala, and Gedaref
      persists, but the trajectory suggests a continued offensive. The stability
      and safety of these regions are thus uncertain. In a separate incident, a
      WFP warehouse in Al Jazeera was looted after RSF took over Wad Medani,
      leading to significant displacement of IDPs and host communities to
      various regions. Many Jazeera staff were relocated to the Blue Nile office
      following the conflict.\",             \"The Wunthow/Joda Border in Renk
      County State of South Sudan is the primary entry point for individuals
      escaping the Sudanese conflict, comprising 85% of all new arrivals in
      South Sudan. From mid-April 2023 to January 31, 2024, 452,886 individuals
      from 100,202 households entered South Sudan through this border. Children
      under 5 make up 19%, with women constituting 51%. Refugees, accounting for
      approximately 33%, include slightly over half of Sudanese. By January 31,
      161,074 individuals had their movement facilitated beyond Renk County.
      UNHCR and IOM moved an average of 3,000 people out of Renk weekly in
      January, creating a backlog of over 5,000 individuals weekly. Renk hosts
      around 58,599 individuals, with 58% settled in the host community and the
      rest in collective centers. The New Transit Center (TC2), the Old (TC1),
      and the adjacent outside area accommodate 25,415 individuals, with
      refugees comprising about 52%. UNHCR transports 300-400 refugees to Maban
      weekly, although notable resistance exists among refugees to relocate to
      Maban camps.\",             \"An estimated 5.8 million people, over 32% of
      Chad's population, require humanitarian assistance due to protracted
      conflict, displacement, and climate shocks. The influx of nearly 500,000
      Sudanese refugees since April 2023, almost doubling the total refugee
      population, puts immense pressure on resources and
      infrastructure.\",             \"Nearly 2.9 million people are projected
      to face acute food insecurity during the lean season, with eastern Chad
      bearing the brunt due to below-average rainfall, refugee influx, and
      disruption of livelihoods. Insecurity in Lac Province further hinders
      access to emergency food aid, highlighting the urgent need for secure
      humanitarian corridors. Children, women, and the elderly in both refugee
      and host communities face urgent needs for shelter, healthcare, food,
      clean water, sanitation, and protection services. Addressing gender-based
      violence (GBV) prevention and response within refugee camps and host
      communities is also crucial.\",             \"\\nSudan\\n+ 2

      (Benin, Cote d\\u2019Ivoire, the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, the

      Nine countries in the region hosting large-scale humanitarian emergencies

      a critical challenge in 2023. In addition to the spillover from the Sahel
      Crisis that has been impacting Benin, Togo, Cote d\\u2019Ivoire and Ghana,
      the outbreak of conflict in Sudan led hundreds of thousands of refugees4
      to flee into neighbouring Chad (496,834) and the Central African Republic
      (21,135), countries that are already responding to high levels of
      humanitarian needs.\",             \"UNICEF expanded operations in eastern
      Chad in response, activating an L2 scale-up and deploying resources to
      Farchana and Abeche to meet the needs of the arriving refugees. In
      addition to conflicts, the outbreak of Marburg Virus in Equatorial Guinea
      in early 2023 led to multicountry public health emergency coordination and
      preparedness measures in Gabon and Cameroon to prevent the spread of the
      disease.\",             \"Whilst West and Central Africa has witnessed
      numerous coup d\\u2019\\u00e9tat in recent years, political instability
      was particularly high in 2023. The fallout from the July 2023 coup in
      Niger led to the imposition of sanctions, and obstacles to ways of working
      that impacted supply chains beyond Niger. This was followed by a coup in
      Gabon in August 2023 and political instability in several other countries
      including Guinea Bissau and Sierra Leone later in the year. In Mali, the
      announcement in July 2023 of the expulsion of MINUSMA created a volatile
      operating environment and the subsequent military operations have seen
      displacements into Mauritania and other neighbouring countries. The UNICEF
      West and Central Africa Regional Office has supported initiatives across

      in Guinea enabled UNICEF to prepare and response to a fuel explosion in
      Conakry late in the year. Following large political protests in Senegal in
      2023 that saw the closure of some schools and protection risks for

  You are an expert in writing rich and dense summaries in broad domains.

  You will generate increasingly concise, entity-dense summaries of the above JSON list of data extracted.

  Repeat the following 2 steps 5 times.

  - Step 1: Identify 1-3 informative Entities from the Article
  which are missing from the previously generated summary and are the most
  relevant.

  - Step 2: Write a new, denser summary of identical length which covers
  every entity and detail from the previous summary plus the missing entities

  A Missing Entity is:

  - Relevant: to the main story
  - Specific: descriptive yet concise (5 words or fewer)
  - Novel: not in the previous summary
  - Faithful: present in the Article
  - Anywhere: located anywhere in the Article

  Guidelines:
  - The first summary should be long (5 paragraphs) yet
  highly non-specific, containing little information beyond the entities
  marked as missing.

  - Use overly verbose language and fillers (e.g. "this article discusses") to
  reach approx. 

  - Make every word count: re-write the previous summary to improve flow and
  make space for additional entities.

  - Make space with fusion, compression, and removal of uninformative phrases
  like "the article discusses"

  - The summaries should become highly dense and concise yet self-contained,
  e.g., easily understood without the Article.

  - Missing entities can appear anywhere in the new summary.

  - Never drop entities from the previous summary. If space cannot be made,
  add fewer new entities.

  > Remember to use the exact same number of words for each summary.
  Answer in JSON.

  > The JSON in `summaries_per_step` should be a list (length 5) of
  dictionaries whose keys are "missing_entities" and "denser_summary".
